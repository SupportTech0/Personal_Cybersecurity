        <p>Losing your phone can be overwhelming, but acting quickly can help protect your data and improve your chances of recovery. Follow these steps to take immediate action:</p>

        <section>
            <h3>1. Locate Your Phone</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>iPhone Users:</strong> Open the "Find My" app on another Apple device or visit <a href="https://www.icloud.com/" target="_blank">iCloud.com</a> to track your phone. If it’s nearby, use the "Play Sound" feature to locate it.</li>
                <li><strong>Android Users:</strong> Go to <a href="https://www.android.com/find" target="_blank">android.com/find</a> using a web browser to locate your phone. You can also play a sound if it’s close.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>2. Secure Your Phone Remotely</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>iPhone:</strong> Use "Lost Mode" through the "Find My" app or iCloud to lock your device. You can display a custom message with contact information on the screen.</li>

            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>3. Erase Your Data (if needed)</h3>
            <p>If recovery seems unlikely, protect your personal information by erasing the phone’s data remotely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>iPhone:</strong> Choose "Erase iPhone" in the "Find My" app or on iCloud.</li>
                <li><strong>Android:</strong> Use the "Erase Device" option in "Find My Device."</li>

        </section>

        <section>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Police:</strong> File a report with your local police. Provide them with your phone’s IMEI number (you can find it on the device box or dial *#06# on your phone to find it). Share any tracking details to assist their investigation.</li>

                <li>Suspend your service to prevent unauthorized use.</li>
                <li>Help locate the device or blacklist it, making it unusable.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>6. Update Your Passwords and Security Settings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Change passwords for all accounts linked to your phone, especially email, banking, and social media accounts.</li>
